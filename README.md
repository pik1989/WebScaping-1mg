## Web Scraping

 **Data Scraping** also known as **Web Scraping** is the process of importing information from a website into a spreadsheet or local file saved on your computer. Itâ€™s one of the most efficient ways to get data from the web, and in some cases to channel that data to another website. Popular uses of data scraping include:

- Research for web content/business intelligence
- Pricing for travel booker sites/price comparison sites
- Finding sales leads/conducting market research by crawling public data sources (e.g. Yell and Twitter)
- Sending product data from an e-commerce site to another online vendor (e.g. Google Shopping)
